Telegram change bot
Implement a small exchange rate telegram bot which does the following: 
Uses exchange rate data from this web service: https://exchangeratesapi.io or similar. 
Returns the latest exchange rates in a listview. USD should be used as base currency and converts currency from the list.

Requirements.
Add the following commands:
/list or /lst - returns list of all available rates from: https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest?base=USD. 
Item of the listview should have 2 rows: the currency name in the first row and the latest exchange rate 
(with two decimal precision) in the second row:

Ex. 
DKK: 6.74
HUF: 299.56
      ....
Once the currency data is loaded from the service, save it in a local database too. 
Also, save the timestamp of the last request somewhere. 
Next time user requests anything the app you should check whether 10 minutes elapsed since the last request:
If yes, you should load new data from web service.
If no, you should load previously saved data from the local database.
/exchange $10 to CAD or  /exchange 10 USD to CAD - converts to the second currency with two decimal precision and return.
Ex.:  $15.55
/history USD/CAD for 7 days - return an image graph chart which shows the exchange rate graph/chart 
of the selected currency for the last 7 days. Here it is not necessary to save anything in the local database,
you should request every time the currency data for the last 7 days. Example request for getting currency history in a given period between USD and CAD: https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/history?start_at=2019-11-27&end_at=2019-12-03&base=USD&symbols=CAD
Results must be given as sources and short instruction how to run it.

You can use any third party library for drawing currency graph/chart. 
If web service doesn’t return data for the last 7 days,
please show a warning popup with the following message: “No exchange rate data is available for the selected currency.
